## About the Project

The PBMR (Program Berikhtiar Menambah Rezeki) system is a comprehensive system developed to streamline and manage the lifecycle of Sahabats loans and associated financial activities. It provides Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) with a powerful tool to track key financial metrics, including loans, Sahabats activities, and transaction flows such as inflows and outflows.

PBMR is built to enhance financial visibility by offering real-time insights into Sahabats portfolios, enabling AIM to monitor loan performance, track repayments, and assess financial health throughout the loan duration. 

The PBMR system was designed to improve efficiency in financial operations, provide transparency, and offer an enhanced experience for both AIM and Sahabats. Its ultimate goal is to optimize the management of financial portfolios, ensuring seamless loan administration and fostering growth in AIM clientele.
